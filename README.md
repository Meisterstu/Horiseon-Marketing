# Horiseon-Marketing

## Description

Client required the codebase of their website to follow accessibilty standards and ensure optimization for search engines.
Our instruction was to take the existing HTML and CSS code and refractor it.
In order to achieve this the code was reviewed and semantic elements added to HTML, alt attributes added to images and links were tested and where required then repaired.
The CSS code was also reviewed and where possible the selectors and properties were consolidated and re-organized to follow semantic structure.
